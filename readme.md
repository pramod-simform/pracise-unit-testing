## Introduction

This repository includes demo functions specifically created for generating test cases.

## Tool Usage

I'm utilizing Codium for assistance, marked by the //Codium comment within the test cases derived from it.

## Code Enhancement

Furthermore, I've incorporated commits for refining functions based on suggestions from Codium after evaluating my code.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Node.js (version 10 or higher) is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or navigate to your project folder in the terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm test` to execute Jest and run the tests defined in your project.

Note: Ensure that your tests are placed in files that match the Jest default naming convention (`*.test.js` or `*.spec.js`). Adjust the Jest configuration in `package.json` if your test files follow a different naming convention or are located in a different directory.

For more information on Jest, visit [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/).
